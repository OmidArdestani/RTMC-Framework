# RT-Micro-C Compiler Upgrade Documentation

## Overview

The RT-Micro-C compiler has been upgraded with 5 major new features to improve struct handling, add pointer support, enable C-style inheritance, fix debug information, and add compilation modes.

## 1. Fixed Struct Offset Resolution and Size Calculation

### Problem Solved
Previously, the compiler used hardcoded field offsets and returned a fixed 16-byte size for all structs. This has been completely rewritten.

### New Features
- **Accurate struct size calculation**: Structs now have their actual size computed based on field sizes and alignment requirements
- **Proper field offset calculation**: Field offsets are calculated considering data alignment and nested structs
- **Bit-field support**: Bit-fields are properly packed and aligned with correct bit offset tracking
- **Nested struct support**: Structs containing other structs are handled correctly

### Implementation Details
- New `StructLayoutTable` class manages all struct layout information
- Field offsets are computed with proper alignment (1-byte for char, 4-byte for int/float, 8-byte for pointers)
- Bit-fields are packed into bytes with proper bit offset tracking
- Struct inheritance is detected automatically when the first field is another struct type

### Example
```c
struct InnerStruct {
    char a;      // offset 0, size 1
    int b;       // offset 4, size 4 (aligned to 4-byte boundary)
};               // total size: 8 bytes

struct OuterStruct {
    InnerStruct inner;  // offset 0, size 8
    float value;        // offset 8, size 4
};                      // total size: 12 bytes
```

## 2. Pointer and Pointer-to-Pointer Support

### New Syntax Supported
```c
int a = 10;
int *b = &a;          // Single pointer
int **c = &b;         // Double pointer
int d = **c;          // Dereference double pointer
```

### AST Nodes Added
- `PointerTypeNode`: Represents pointer types with level support (*, **, etc.)
- `PointerDeclNode`: Extends VariableDeclNode for pointer declarations
- `AddressOfNode`: Represents address-of operator (&)
- `DereferenceNode`: Represents dereference operator (*)

### Bytecode Instructions Added
- `LOAD_ADDR <var>`: Load address of a variable onto stack
- `LOAD_DEREF`: Dereference pointer on stack
- `STORE_DEREF`: Store value at address pointed to by stack value

### Type System
- Pointers are 8 bytes (64-bit)
- Pointer arithmetic is supported
- Type checking ensures & and * operations are balanced

## 3. Structure Inheritance (C-style)

### Feature Description
Allows struct A to be included as the first field in struct B to simulate inheritance.

### Example
```c
struct Base {
    int id;
    char status;
};

struct Derived {
    Base base;           // First field creates inheritance
    float extra_data;
};
```

### Implementation
- When the first field of a struct is another struct type, inheritance is automatically detected
- The base struct field is placed at offset 0
- `get_base_struct()` and `is_substruct()` functions provide inheritance queries
- Enables casting from Derived* to Base* at runtime

### Benefits
- Enables object-oriented programming patterns in C
- Supports polymorphism through base pointer casting
- Maintains C compatibility

## 4. Fixed Line Numbers in Bytecode Debug Info

### Problem Solved
Previously, all bytecode instructions had line = 0, making debugging impossible.

### New Features
- Every AST node now carries accurate line and column information
- Bytecode instructions embed source line numbers
- Debug info table maps instruction addresses to source lines
- Enhanced error reporting with precise source locations

### Implementation
- `ASTNode` base class now accepts line and column parameters
- `BytecodeGenerator.emit()` propagates line numbers to instructions
- `Instruction` class enhanced with column support
- Debug info table: `Dict[int, int]` mapping instruction_index â†’ source_line

### Example Debug Output
```
Instruction 0x0010: LOAD_VAR 2    // Line 15, Column 8
Instruction 0x0011: LOAD_CONST 0  // Line 15, Column 12
Instruction 0x0012: ADD           // Line 15, Column 11
```

## 5. Debug and Release Modes for Bytecode Generation

### Compilation Modes
- **Debug Mode** (default): Includes all debug information
- **Release Mode**: Strips debug information for smaller, faster code

### Debug Mode Features
- Full symbol names preserved
- Line numbers embedded in instructions
- Struct field metadata included
- Comment instructions for documentation
- Complete debug info table

### Release Mode Features
- Debug information stripped
- Smaller bytecode files
- Faster execution (no debug overhead)
- Compressed constant pool (planned)

### Usage
```bash
# Debug mode (default)
python main.py source.rtmc

# Release mode
python main.py --release source.rtmc
```

### Implementation
- `CompileMode` enum: DEBUG, RELEASE
- `BytecodeGenerator` accepts mode parameter
- Debug info generation wrapped in `if mode == CompileMode.DEBUG`
- `.vmb` header includes compilation mode

## API Reference

### New Classes

#### StructLayoutTable
```python
class StructLayoutTable:
    def register_struct(self, struct_decl: StructDeclNode)
    def calculate_layout(self, struct_name: str) -> StructLayout
    def get_field_offset(self, struct_name: str, field_path: str) -> int
    def get_bit_field_info(self, struct_name: str, field_path: str) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, int]]
    def get_struct_size(self, struct_name: str) -> int
    def get_base_struct(self, struct_name: str) -> Optional[str]
    def is_substruct(self, child_struct: str, base_struct: str) -> bool
```

#### Enhanced BytecodeGenerator
```python
class BytecodeGenerator:
    def __init__(self, mode: CompileMode = CompileMode.DEBUG)
    def set_current_position(self, line: int, column: int = 0)
    def emit(self, instruction: Instruction)  # Now includes line tracking
```

### New AST Nodes

#### PointerTypeNode
```python
class PointerTypeNode(TypeNode):
    def __init__(self, base_type: TypeNode, pointer_level: int = 1, line: int = 0, column: int = 0)
```

#### AddressOfNode
```python
class AddressOfNode(ExpressionNode):
    def __init__(self, operand: ExpressionNode, line: int = 0, column: int = 0)
```

#### DereferenceNode
```python
class DereferenceNode(ExpressionNode):
    def __init__(self, operand: ExpressionNode, line: int = 0, column: int = 0)
```

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Code
1. Existing struct declarations will automatically benefit from accurate size calculation
2. No changes needed for basic struct usage
3. Bit-fields will be properly packed instead of using fixed offsets

### For New Code
1. Use pointer syntax: `int *ptr = &variable;`
2. Use struct inheritance: Place base struct as first field
3. Use `--release` flag for production builds
4. Enhanced debugging information available in debug mode

## Performance Impact

### Debug Mode
- Slightly larger bytecode due to debug information
- Minimal runtime overhead for debug info
- Better debugging experience

### Release Mode
- Smaller bytecode files
- Faster execution (no debug overhead)
- Optimized for production use

### Struct Operations
- More accurate but potentially slower size calculations
- Better memory utilization due to proper alignment
- Improved performance for nested struct operations

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
python test_upgrade.py
```

This tests:
- Struct layout calculation
- Pointer AST nodes
- Compilation modes
- Bit-field support

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. Constant pool compression in release mode
2. Advanced pointer arithmetic optimizations
3. Multiple inheritance support

5. Source map generation for debugging

### Extension Points
